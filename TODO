todoList:
  UI:
  ☐ task 3 categories (boulder, pebble, sand)
    if boulder is marked it jumps to the top
    boulders should stand out visually
  ☐ add a completed button
  
  Logic:
  ☐ move completed todos to the a seperate completed section
  ☐ make completed todos reviveable (copy it to the open section again)
