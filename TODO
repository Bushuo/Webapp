todoList:
  UI:
  ☐ task 3 categories (boulder, pebble, sand)
    if boulder is marked it jumps to the top
    to its container
    boulders should stand out visually
  ☐ add a completed button
  ☐ different containers should be hide able/foldable

  Logic:
  ☐ move completed todos to the a separate completed section
  ☐ make completed todos revivable (copy it to the open section again)
  ☐ make a boulder container
  ☐ make a pebble container
  ☐ make a sand containers
  ☐ open tasks is fusion of the three containers
